 ## What is Nzym
 Nzym is a high-level programming language that is geared towards the development of media and web applications, both for the mobile and desktop platforms. The main philosophy of Nzym is to make coding easier, better and faster. This is through the adoption of a typing discipline that is weak but dynamic and compile tools that deploy with the use of some pre-built objects.
